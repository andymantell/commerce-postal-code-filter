Provides postcode blacklisting functionality for Drupal Commerce, allowing you
to specify full or partial postcodes which cannot complete checkout. This might
be used for example if you did not want to deliver to certain areas of the
country.

Planned features:

* Store blocked postcodes in a table instead of a comma separated variable
(Features integration?)
* CSV import of postcodes
* Whitelisting in addition the current blacklisting mode
